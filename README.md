pycrypt
=======

A Python module for encryption and decyrtion. It currently has two different encryption methods. The first is a regular Ceaser cypher where the alphabet is shifted and all input text is encrypted using one key. The second is a Ceaser cypher where a different alphabet shift is used for each letter, resulting in a much longer key, depending on the input.
